# Branches

A simple command-line utility to list your git branches by date.

I've Googled way too many times how to list your git branches by date and since the command is too complicated to actually remember or type out I decided to make this a ruby gem that you can execute from the command line.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install branches

## Usage

Type `branches` from the command line inside of a git repo.

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/oblakeerickson/branches/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
